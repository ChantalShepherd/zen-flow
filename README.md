UX
### Pre-project Planning
>When deciding on this project i knew i wanted to create my website based around wellness. I had to figure out which website would have the most growth and traffic of customers. This was between Yoga, Meditation or Mindfulness.

>I saw this as an opportunity to craft an intuitive and visually engaging platform that promotes health and balance. 

I came to the conclusion that the best path forward would be to build a Service website about Yoga.

This above preplanning helped me to determine the type of project & industry to build for.

### Strategy Plane
User
> As a user I want to be able to find a wellness centre that caters to all types of yoga.  
> As a user I want to be able to signup to classes straight online.
> As a user I want to be able to see evidence of the merchants work & read testimonials as proof.  
> As a user I want to be able to find out when and where the classes ran.

Business Owner
> As the site owner I want to be able to showcase my business to prospective customers.  
> As the site owner I want to build trust and showcase details of classes that i have conducted.  
> As the site owner I want to create leads and provide customers a way to sign up online. 

### Scope Plane
> The website should have a Navigation menu that is consistent across all pages and devices.  
> The website should have a welcome message for the user explaining to them who we are and what we do.  
> The website should neatly and appropriatly list the membership plans we provide to the user.  
> The website should give the user proof of work completed through testimonials.  
> The website should give the user a way to signup through a form. 
> The website should give the user more contact via a physical address.

## Structure Plane
> To acheieve the goals of the above the website should include at least 4 pages consisting of:  Home, About, Membership and Signup.  

**Home Page**
> Navigation with links  
> Queen welcome message with call to action to take user to signup form.  
> Information regarding various classes provided with images. 
> Explanation of the benefits of Yoga.
> Testimonials showcasing reviews and work completed from users of this business.
> Footer section with adress of the business along with links to the businesses social media pages.

**About Page**
> Queen welcome message with call to action to take user to signup form.  
> Showcases blog posts.
> Owner testimony message to inspire users.
> Gallery of images of classes taken place. 
> > Footer section with adress of the business along with links to the businesses social media pages.

**Membership**
> Queen welcome message with call to action to take user to signup form. 
> Cards displaying prices of different memberships. 

**SignUp**
> A form for the user to sign up to yoga classes.  
> The form should collect contact details for the customer so that the merchant can contact them back.
> The form should include an option for the user to select if they want to choose a membership. 
> The form should include information that gives the user a choice of selecting a type of wellness they are interested in which will give usueful data to the merchant.
> The contact form should give user feedback on submission.

RESPONSIVE WIREFRAME MOBILE

> The design flow in this website was meant to showcase a balanced minimal design that provided relevant information in a concise format on all devices.  
> As the project was created, the intial design did not provide the flow that was expected in the pre project stage. The project was then adapted to help with this during development.  
> The color theme was taken from the queen pictures t-shirt and use of these pastel colors was used throughout the other pages on the website to create fluidity and consistency. 
> Additional color came from banners,and images to create contrast.  

## Surface Plane

### Color
> I decided the best approach to this website was an attempt at minimilistic design with rare pops of colour. Most other websites of this industry had either gone for too much in terms of design or too little and just provide a very poor user experience.

> The decision was to stick with these set colors for the base 

 - #fafa - Off White
 - rgba(216, 198, 202, .7) - light pastel pink
 
And the occasional use of the below colors to create a subtle contrast.

- rgba(186, 168, 172, 0.7) -medium pastel pink
- rgba(60, 60, 60, 0.6) - dark pastel pink
- #3a3a - dark grey

>Most additional color came through the images with the exception being the Queen Overlay, banners and the Sign Up form.

### Typography - 

>The font's chosen for this project were:

 - Oswald
 - Lato
 - Sans Serif

> The rationale was that I wanted all of the information provided on the website to be clear, concise and without any unnecessary distractions. 
> My focus was to also assist with users who may have visual impairments.

## Features

#### Navigation Bar
NAV IMAGE

> Navigation Bar developed using Flex and contains 4 links to each page home, about, membership and signup. 

#### Hero Section
QUEEN IMAGE

> Image with a box overlay with Call to action link stating 7 day free trial. This link will take the user to the sign up form on signup.html.

#### Services Section
MEMBERSHIP IMAGE

> This was initially a gallery page but i felt it didnt suit the website flow. I changed it to a membership page to give users more information about what services were on offer. 
> I used a card format to display this.  

#### Testimonials
REVIEWS IMAGE

> General card idea was based around others I have seen and used on modern websites. Then i styled it to how i wished the site to look. 
> I edited images took from pexels (https://www.pexels.com/) on canva (https://www.canva.com/) to achieve my desired results for the authors.  

#### Footer
FOOTER IMAGE

> Flex footer used to showcase social media icons as well as physical address and copyrighting.  

### Banner
BANNER IMAGES

> Added banners to the home and about page to use up unwanted white space through use of icons from flaticon (https://www.flaticon.com/search?word=strength), text and gradient color. 

### Images
IMAGES PICTURE

> Use of images was carefully selected from the website pexels (https://www.pexels.com/) to fit in a square, vertical or horizontal position. 
>This was showcased throughout the wesbite to provide a better user experience. 

### Home
LINK

> The home page was coming across very bland with alot of white space. So i added more different types of elements to make it more original using cards, and banners. 

#### About
LINK

> The about section was initially intended to be a page about the bio of a few of the trainers with image, author name below and social media links. As the project progressed I decided to reduce this section for now as editing and fining the images proved impossible.

#### Membership
LINK

> The membership section was originally intended to be a gallery page displaying images in a collage format, i struggled severly with this and felt the users were lacking pricing information. So i completely overhauled the whole page to include this.

#### Signup Form
LINK

> I didnt really have any trouble with the form, howvever i felt it was missing a drop down menu for the mememberships so i included this as an extra element.I also felt that with the use of text inputs, drop down menus and radio buttons helped keep the form interesting for user expereince.   

>I also like the contrast of color of the form and the background image. I did at the start have a different image which displayed an elderly lady holding a yoga mat which i loved, as i felt it created diversity towards users. I didnt want the website to be based around women as i had chosen pastel pinks shades for color and this image matched perfectly. So i changed to a different one to accomodate. 

> This decision to forward to a new page was taken to improve user experience when using this project.

### Home page

>If i had more time i would of added more elements to the landing page to engage users more and include javascript to make it more animated with elements appearing via sliding in just like powerpoint for microsoft.
>I would of liked to included a link image to the logo on every pages header. 

### About Page
> In the future I would like to add more text describing the business. Alos adding a breakdown of all the trainers at the business. Including their name, image, and social media links. 

### Membership Page
> I would of liked to add a feature to the cards that when the user clicked on each card it would turn over and display more information. 

### SignUp Page
>I have not developed a back end for the signup form, i used the code institute default from Love Running. This would be crucial for any business to recieve data from their interactive users and i would of included this if i knew how and had time.

### Additional Page ideas
>I would like to add a chat bot feature so customers could ask more about the classes that they wished to sign up to.
> I would use javascript throughout my website to make it more animated. 
> I would add more pages to include other wellness options such as meditation and breathwork workshops to increase revenue for the business.
